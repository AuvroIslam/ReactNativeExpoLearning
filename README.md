# React Native Expo Learning

## React Native vs Expo

- **React Native**: Complex setup
- **Expo**: Makes development easier
- **Cross-platform advantage**: iOS app can't be built in Windows using React Native, but with Expo you can


## Hello World

- **Node.js**: Latest version download
- **Follow documentation**: `npx create-expo-app --template blank` (without the Expo Router navigation system)
- **Start the app**: `npm start` (App.js works as root file when we start the server)
- **Create your first app**: Go and type "Hello World" there


## Core Components

- **Import requirement**: Need to import core components

### View

- **Space usage**: Only takes space occupied by its children
- **Full screen**: Using `flex: 1` so view takes all available screen
- **Nested components**: Nested view components (view is like div, so the second one will go below the first view as they are in block)


### Text

- **Text wrapping**: All text must be wrapped inside Text component
- **Nesting allowed**: Nesting of Text component is also allowed
